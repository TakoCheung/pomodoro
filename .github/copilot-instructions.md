ðŸš¦ Universal Copilot TDD Executor (Flutter + Riverpod) â€” With Explicit Integration Testing

Copilot Goal
Autonomously make the Flutter app fully green and validated end-to-end for the feature I provide below, using strict TDD loops and final iOS simulator checks via ios-simulator-mcp.

Operation Mode
	â€¢	Fully agentic; do not wait for approvals.
	â€¢	Follow Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor for every sub-behavior.
	â€¢	Keep edits minimal and focused; no unrelated features or broad refactors.
	â€¢	Constrain all edits to the project repo; preserve style/naming.

Context & Stack
Flutter â€¢ Riverpod (flutter_riverpod, hooks_riverpod) â€¢ http â€¢ flutter_dotenv â€¢ shared_preferences â€¢ Tests: flutter_test, golden_toolkit, integration_test, mocktail.
Prefer provider overrides for time/clock, randomness, env, and persistence in tests. No real network in testsâ€”use mocks/fakes.

âœ… Acceptance Criteria (applies to every feature)
	â€¢	Testing (Unit â†’ Widget â†’ Integration):
	â€¢	Add/adjust failing tests first that fully specify the feature.
	â€¢	Use provider overrides & mocks: no real network; no sleeps/long waits.
	â€¢	All tests pass locally; eliminate flakiness.
	â€¢	Integration Testing (explicit):
	â€¢	Implement integration_test/<feature>_flow_test.dart covering the end-to-end user flow.
	â€¢	Use Keys for selection, fake clocks, and provider overrides for env/prefs/services.
	â€¢	Save screenshots and logs to artifacts/ios/<feature>_flow.png (and logs to artifacts/logs/ if applicable).
	â€¢	iOS Simulator (via ios-simulator-mcp):
	â€¢	App launches on iPhone simulator.
	â€¢	Perform the feature-specific flow using provided Keys.
	â€¢	Assert expected widgets/state; capture screenshot to artifacts/ios/<feature>_flow.png.
	â€¢	Docs:
	â€¢	Update README.md if new env flags/usage or test instructions are introduced.
	â€¢	No scope creep: implement only what the tests demand.

ðŸ”„ TDD Working Agreement (repeat until feature is done)

For each tiny behavior:
	1.	RED â€” Write/adjust failing tests
	â€¢	Unit for pure logic/state machines.
	â€¢	Widget for UI state/rendering.
	â€¢	Integration for end-to-end flow (navigation, dialogs, persistence).
	â€¢	Inject/override clock, RNG, env, prefs, repositories/services.
	â€¢	Mock HTTP with mocktail (retry/timeout/caching logic verified deterministically).
	2.	GREEN â€” Implement the minimum
	â€¢	Change as little code as needed to satisfy the failing tests.
	â€¢	Avoid speculative abstractions.
	3.	REFACTOR â€” Improve safely
	â€¢	Clean names, extract helpers, remove duplicationâ€”with all tests passing.
	â€¢	No behavior expansion without new failing tests.
	4.	Run the whole suite
	â€¢	flutter test and flutter test integration_test (or flutter drive where driver is used).
	â€¢	Fix flakiness immediately (fake clocks > timers; direct triggers > waits).
	5.	Checkpoint Output (concise)
	â€¢	Files changed (paths).
	â€¢	Tests added/updated.
	â€¢	Test run summary (counts & duration).

Repeat until all acceptance criteria are met.

ðŸ§ª Test Authoring Rules (always)
	â€¢	Unit tests: pure functions/state transitions; verify formatting, boundaries, retries/backoff.
	â€¢	Widget tests: Keys on all interactive/observed widgets; pump with fake time/clock.
	â€¢	Integration tests: real navigation + provider overrides; no network; stable selectors by Key.
	â€¢	Timing: inject fake clock / explicit triggers (e.g., triggerComplete()); never rely on real timeouts.
	â€¢	Persistence: in-memory or temp SharedPreferences; clear between tests.
	â€¢	Retries/Backoff: verify max retries & terminal failure deterministically via mocks.

ðŸ§© Integration Testing â€” Structure & Conventions
	â€¢	Location: integration_test/<feature>_flow_test.dart
	â€¢	Harness:
	â€¢	Use IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized().
	â€¢	Wrap app boot with provider overrides (env/prefs/services/clock/RNG).
	â€¢	Ensure WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() where necessary for plugins.
	â€¢	Selectors: use Key('...') for all tappable/asserter widgets.
	â€¢	Clock control: inject fake clock or expose deterministic triggers to avoid pumpAndSettle flakiness.
	â€¢	Artifacts: save at least one screenshot â†’ artifacts/ios/<feature>_flow.png.
	â€¢	Isolation: reset prefs/mocks between tests; avoid shared state across tests.

â¸»

ðŸ“± iOS Simulator Validation (generic flow)
	â€¢	Ensure debug build & .env flags (e.g., ENABLE_DEBUG_FAB=true if needed).
	â€¢	Boot simulator (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro).
	â€¢	Wait for main title Key (e.g., Key('app_title')).
	â€¢	Perform the feature-specific sequence using Keys from the Feature Slot.
	â€¢	Assert final UI state; save screenshot to artifacts/ios/<feature>_flow.png.

â¸»

ðŸ§­ Guardrails & Prohibited Actions
	â€¢	No real HTTP calls in tests.
	â€¢	No arbitrary waits/sleeps; use fake time or direct triggers.
	â€¢	No large refactors or cross-cutting style changes.
	â€¢	Keep changes within the project; maintain existing naming/style.

â¸»

ðŸ“Š Final Output (always provide)
	â€¢	Test results summary (counts, pass time).
	â€¢	List of modified files with brief rationale.
	â€¢	iOS simulator validation steps executed and screenshot path.

1. The first step that I did was to add the flutter extension in VSCODE.
2. Add the flutter that vscode download to the $PATH by running ```bash export PATH=".:$PATH:/yoursPath/flutter/bin"```.
3. The extension in vscode handle most of the installation of package needed expect one: cocoapods.
4. Run ```bash flutter doctor``` and make sure all dependcies are installed.
5. Adding [riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/docs/introduction/getting_started) to the project.
